# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Project from Coursera

This repository was created by Juan CÃ³rdova and for the submission of the Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It has the development of all the instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.

The data set that was downloaded and used was about Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones:

Files
- CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data

- run_analysis.R performs the data preparation and following the 5 steps in the course project:
      1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
      2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
      3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
      4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
      5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
     
- FinalTidyData.txt is the final exported txt file with the Data Frame from step 5.
